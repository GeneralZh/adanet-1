# ADANET

AdaNet: Adaptive Structural Learning of Artificial Neural Networks
ADANET project is a Python implementation based on an article by Cortes: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/cortes17a.html

## Article Abstract

We present a new theoretical framework for analyzing and learning artificial neural
networks. Our approach simultaneously and adaptively learns both the structure
of the network as well as its weights. The methodology is based upon and accompanied
by strong data-dependent theoretical learning guarantees. We present
some preliminary results to show that the final network architecture adapts to the
complexity of a given problem.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
